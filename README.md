# Checkers

## Using It
Play by selecting your piece and clicking on the tile you want to move to. The object of the game is to jump the other players pieces and take them until the other player has run out of their pieces.  

## Code
The code supports all the features of checkers including kingship and double/triple/quadruple jumping. The Board object controls the board and therefore the game. The pieces and tiles instances are used in the game for checking whether a piece can be moved, moving a piece, deleting a piece, checking whether tile is in range, and much more. The script is fully commented and original.

This code was taking from codethejason's account. All of the origina code was his, I just edited a few things. Some colors and font were changed.
